"A journey of self improvement, whether you like it or not"

This project aims to *require* me to be more productive. I find quite often that I have many goals I'd like to achieve, however, they get thrown by the wayside when I *ehem* "readjust" my priorities last minute.

This project is inspired by: <br>

Which is an alarm clock that forces you to get up in the morning.

The first phase of the project will probably just be social media (and other time-waster) password changing until a criteria is met. Below is a first stab at a feature set required to enable that.

#### Feature Set
* Change PW for:
  * instagram
  * facebook
  * twitter


### Technical Details
The **plan** is to have a server(-less ?) (I'm thinking AWS Lambda) that will basically check on pre-determined requirements to make sure they've been done, if they aren't something is taken away.

#### Examples:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Requirement</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10 commits a month to open source projects.</td>
    <td>Instagram password is changed for 2 days.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

OR Maybe a list of requirements and a lump-sum punishment.

**Requirements (Weekly)**
1. 10 commits to GitHub.
2. 1 Blog Post to Medium.
3. 3 Algorithms completed on HackerRank.
etc..

**Punishment**
Locked out of all social media accounts until requirements finished. (Would have to manually re-check with some checking command)

### Other Project Examples
I found a couple other projects that do similar things, although are more concerned about focusing in the moment rather than a weekly requirement. Could be of interest. Maybe start this project off with something small like a program that forces you to complete some sort of task. An idea could be at the end of the day it requires you to check your e-mails or something and if you don't it locks up your computer until you do.
